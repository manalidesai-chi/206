In the modern age, where things are no longer quite as black and white; the Beans strive to be as inclusive as possible by skirting the lines between many genres within their unique sound. Music can encompass so many different feels and emotions and it is the band\u2019s goal to incorporate as much of it as they can into their sound and sometimes even one composition. Listeners are left with a danceable ode to funk, rock, bluegrass, americana, livetronica, world, prog, and more. Fans have effectively dubbed the genres they hear as spacefunk, ameritronica, and groovegrass.\r\n\r\nToday\u2019s modern music listener no longer defines themselves within one genre, in favor of enjoying as much diversity as they can. It is upon this new musical paradigm of inclusivity that the Beans have grown one of the largest fanbases in their region, the self-named \u201cTeam Bean\u201d. The group uses no pre-recorded tracks or samples in favor of a more traditional approach to music; original songwriting and continually pushing the envelope are what have set this group apart. Seamlessly combining traditional genres with modern dance music, Magic Beans strive to be original and expressive of the modern music lover.\r\n\r\nMagic Beans have shared the stage with an eclectic group of musicians: ranging from String Cheese Incident, Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Lotus, Disco Biscuits, Leftover Salmon, ALO, The Motet, to acts like Railroad Earth, Kyle Hollingsworth Band, Great American Taxi, Twiddle, Dopapod, Zac Deputy, Elephant Revival, Greensky Bluegrass, Split Lip Rayfield, Juno What, Papadosio, & The Werks just to name a few. They\u2019ve performed over 400 shows as group across the nation, selling out venues as they go. They host the annual Beanstalk Music Festival in Colorado which sells out every year and plays host to international, national, and regional acts of all kinds.\r\n\r\nScott Hachey \u2013 Electric/Acoustic Guitar, Vocals\r\nChris Duffy \u2013 Bass Guitar\r\nCasey Russell \u2013 Keyboards, Synth, Vocals\r\nCody Wales \u2013 Drums\r\n\r\n-----------\r\nAdventure Dog (Burlington, VT)\r\n\r\nRock 'n' Roll with a ~Funky~ soul.

Produced by guitarist Derek Miller, and written by Miller and singer Alexis Krauss, Reign of Terror is the highly anticipated follow up to 2010's Treats, an album whose deft, stylish combination of genres, sounds, and dynamics was simply unprecedented. Treats' own extreme volume was matched by the deafening roar of praise, landing the band on over 50 year-end lists for 2010. Sleigh Bells toured behind Treats relentlessly, opening for the likes of LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Yeasayer and Major Lazer before headlining their own shows, many of which sold out in minutes.  They played lauded, exhilarating sets at festivals around the globe, confirming their status as a sheer tour de force on the stage. It is this intense live energy, coupled with the continued desire to carve out new musical terrain, which runs throughout their new album, Reign of Terror. Engineered by Shane Stoneback, who helped to record Treats, songs on Reign of Terror are as crushing and authoritative as their title suggests; they're effortlessly robust and heavier than any of the band's previous output, but more melodic as well.

Das New Yorker Trio h\u00e4tte bekanntlich vor lauter Konzerten \u2013 im Jahre 2014 traten sie rund 50 Mal nur in ihrer Heimatstadt auf, von den weiteren Touren wollen wir gar nicht erst anfangen \u2013 fast vergessen ein Album einzuspielen. Also machten sie eine Pause und nahmen ihre \u00fcberaus gefeierte Deb\u00fctplatte \u201eHuman Ceremony\u201c auf, die Anfang des vergangenen Jahres erschien. Anschlie\u00dfend folgten wieder Shows ohne Ende rund um den halben Globus. Anfang des Monats jedoch der Paukenschlag: \u201eI Was A Fool\u201c, ein neuer Song, rotierte im Netz und schlug einen neuen Weg ein. Eine glasklare akustische Gitarre, ein cooler Basslauf, ein Break, die verhallte Stimme bilden das solide Grundger\u00fcst f\u00fcr einen Track, der leichte musikalische Verschiebungen bei gleichbleibend hoher Qualit\u00e4t verspricht. Schon kurz nach ihrer Gr\u00fcndung 2013 waren S\u00e4ngerin und Bassistin Julia Cumming, Gitarrist Nick Kivlen und Schlagzeuger Jacob Faber eine der meistgehandelten Bands der Ostk\u00fcste und l\u00f6sten ihr Versprechen, eine der aufregendsten Bands zu sein, mit ihren unglaublichen Live-Events ganz locker ein. Mit ihrem DIY-Anspruch und einem w\u00fcsten Haufen von Zitaten waren Sunflower Bean wild, unordentlich, sexy, poliert, nihilistisch, belebend, laut, ernsthaft ins musikalische Leben getreten und hypnotisierten ihre Zuh\u00f6rer mit einem einzigartigen Sound. Daran hat sich nichts ge\u00e4ndert. Neu ist das Label: \u201eI Was A Fool\u201c erscheint bei Mom+Pop, bei dem auch so renommierte und besondere Musiker wie Poli\u00e7a, Cloud Nothings, Jagwar Ma, Courtney Barnett oder Tash Sultana unter Vertrag stehen.

In the modern age, where things are no longer quite as black and white; the Beans strive to be as inclusive as possible by skirting the lines between many genres within their unique sound. Music can encompass so many different feels and emotions and it is the band\u2019s goal to incorporate as much of it as they can into their sound and sometimes even one composition. Listeners are left with a danceable ode to funk, rock, bluegrass, americana, livetronica, world, prog, and more. Fans have effectively dubbed the genres they hear as spacefunk, ameritronica, and groovegrass.\r\n\r\nToday\u2019s modern music listener no longer defines themselves within one genre, in favor of enjoying as much diversity as they can. It is upon this new musical paradigm of inclusivity that the Beans have grown one of the largest fanbases in their region, the self-named \u201cTeam Bean\u201d. The group uses no pre-recorded tracks or samples in favor of a more traditional approach to music; original songwriting and continually pushing the envelope are what have set this group apart. Seamlessly combining traditional genres with modern dance music, Magic Beans strive to be original and expressive of the modern music lover.\r\n\r\nMagic Beans have shared the stage with an eclectic group of musicians: ranging from String Cheese Incident, Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Lotus, Disco Biscuits, Leftover Salmon, ALO, The Motet, to acts like Railroad Earth, Kyle Hollingsworth Band, Great American Taxi, Twiddle, Dopapod, Zac Deputy, Elephant Revival, Greensky Bluegrass, Split Lip Rayfield, Juno What, Papadosio, & The Werks just to name a few. They\u2019ve performed over 400 shows as group across the nation, selling out venues as they go. They host the annual Beanstalk Music Festival in Colorado which sells out every year and plays host to international, national, and regional acts of all kinds.\r\n\r\nScott Hachey \u2013 Electric/Acoustic Guitar, Vocals\r\nChris Duffy \u2013 Bass Guitar\r\nCasey Russell \u2013 Keyboards, Synth, Vocals\r\nCody Wales \u2013 Drums\r\n\r\n-----------\r\nAdventure Dog (Burlington, VT)\r\n\r\nRock 'n' Roll with a ~Funky~ soul.

Produced by guitarist Derek Miller, and written by Miller and singer Alexis Krauss, Reign of Terror is the highly anticipated follow up to 2010's Treats, an album whose deft, stylish combination of genres, sounds, and dynamics was simply unprecedented. Treats' own extreme volume was matched by the deafening roar of praise, landing the band on over 50 year-end lists for 2010. Sleigh Bells toured behind Treats relentlessly, opening for the likes of LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Yeasayer and Major Lazer before headlining their own shows, many of which sold out in minutes.  They played lauded, exhilarating sets at festivals around the globe, confirming their status as a sheer tour de force on the stage. It is this intense live energy, coupled with the continued desire to carve out new musical terrain, which runs throughout their new album, Reign of Terror. Engineered by Shane Stoneback, who helped to record Treats, songs on Reign of Terror are as crushing and authoritative as their title suggests; they're effortlessly robust and heavier than any of the band's previous output, but more melodic as well.

Das New Yorker Trio h\u00e4tte bekanntlich vor lauter Konzerten \u2013 im Jahre 2014 traten sie rund 50 Mal nur in ihrer Heimatstadt auf, von den weiteren Touren wollen wir gar nicht erst anfangen \u2013 fast vergessen ein Album einzuspielen. Also machten sie eine Pause und nahmen ihre \u00fcberaus gefeierte Deb\u00fctplatte \u201eHuman Ceremony\u201c auf, die Anfang des vergangenen Jahres erschien. Anschlie\u00dfend folgten wieder Shows ohne Ende rund um den halben Globus. Anfang des Monats jedoch der Paukenschlag: \u201eI Was A Fool\u201c, ein neuer Song, rotierte im Netz und schlug einen neuen Weg ein. Eine glasklare akustische Gitarre, ein cooler Basslauf, ein Break, die verhallte Stimme bilden das solide Grundger\u00fcst f\u00fcr einen Track, der leichte musikalische Verschiebungen bei gleichbleibend hoher Qualit\u00e4t verspricht. Schon kurz nach ihrer Gr\u00fcndung 2013 waren S\u00e4ngerin und Bassistin Julia Cumming, Gitarrist Nick Kivlen und Schlagzeuger Jacob Faber eine der meistgehandelten Bands der Ostk\u00fcste und l\u00f6sten ihr Versprechen, eine der aufregendsten Bands zu sein, mit ihren unglaublichen Live-Events ganz locker ein. Mit ihrem DIY-Anspruch und einem w\u00fcsten Haufen von Zitaten waren Sunflower Bean wild, unordentlich, sexy, poliert, nihilistisch, belebend, laut, ernsthaft ins musikalische Leben getreten und hypnotisierten ihre Zuh\u00f6rer mit einem einzigartigen Sound. Daran hat sich nichts ge\u00e4ndert. Neu ist das Label: \u201eI Was A Fool\u201c erscheint bei Mom+Pop, bei dem auch so renommierte und besondere Musiker wie Poli\u00e7a, Cloud Nothings, Jagwar Ma, Courtney Barnett oder Tash Sultana unter Vertrag stehen.

In the modern age, where things are no longer quite as black and white; the Beans strive to be as inclusive as possible by skirting the lines between many genres within their unique sound. Music can encompass so many different feels and emotions and it is the band\u2019s goal to incorporate as much of it as they can into their sound and sometimes even one composition. Listeners are left with a danceable ode to funk, rock, bluegrass, americana, livetronica, world, prog, and more. Fans have effectively dubbed the genres they hear as spacefunk, ameritronica, and groovegrass.\r\n\r\nToday\u2019s modern music listener no longer defines themselves within one genre, in favor of enjoying as much diversity as they can. It is upon this new musical paradigm of inclusivity that the Beans have grown one of the largest fanbases in their region, the self-named \u201cTeam Bean\u201d. The group uses no pre-recorded tracks or samples in favor of a more traditional approach to music; original songwriting and continually pushing the envelope are what have set this group apart. Seamlessly combining traditional genres with modern dance music, Magic Beans strive to be original and expressive of the modern music lover.\r\n\r\nMagic Beans have shared the stage with an eclectic group of musicians: ranging from String Cheese Incident, Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Lotus, Disco Biscuits, Leftover Salmon, ALO, The Motet, to acts like Railroad Earth, Kyle Hollingsworth Band, Great American Taxi, Twiddle, Dopapod, Zac Deputy, Elephant Revival, Greensky Bluegrass, Split Lip Rayfield, Juno What, Papadosio, & The Werks just to name a few. They\u2019ve performed over 400 shows as group across the nation, selling out venues as they go. They host the annual Beanstalk Music Festival in Colorado which sells out every year and plays host to international, national, and regional acts of all kinds.\r\n\r\nScott Hachey \u2013 Electric/Acoustic Guitar, Vocals\r\nChris Duffy \u2013 Bass Guitar\r\nCasey Russell \u2013 Keyboards, Synth, Vocals\r\nCody Wales \u2013 Drums\r\n\r\n-----------\r\nAdventure Dog (Burlington, VT)\r\n\r\nRock 'n' Roll with a ~Funky~ soul.

Produced by guitarist Derek Miller, and written by Miller and singer Alexis Krauss, Reign of Terror is the highly anticipated follow up to 2010's Treats, an album whose deft, stylish combination of genres, sounds, and dynamics was simply unprecedented. Treats' own extreme volume was matched by the deafening roar of praise, landing the band on over 50 year-end lists for 2010. Sleigh Bells toured behind Treats relentlessly, opening for the likes of LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Yeasayer and Major Lazer before headlining their own shows, many of which sold out in minutes.  They played lauded, exhilarating sets at festivals around the globe, confirming their status as a sheer tour de force on the stage. It is this intense live energy, coupled with the continued desire to carve out new musical terrain, which runs throughout their new album, Reign of Terror. Engineered by Shane Stoneback, who helped to record Treats, songs on Reign of Terror are as crushing and authoritative as their title suggests; they're effortlessly robust and heavier than any of the band's previous output, but more melodic as well. Packed densely with stomping beats, shredding Jackson guitar riffs, sinister ribbons of Alexis Krauss' candy-coated vocals, and the cries of a pep rally gone terribly wrong, Reign of Terror is a record that, like its predecessor, redefines everything you think music can be.  \n\nhttp://reignofterror.tv/", "end_time": "2018-02-07T23:00:00-0600", "name": "Sleigh Bells, Sunflower Bean", "place": {"name": "White Oak Music Hall", "location": {"city": "Houston", "country": "United States", "latitude": 29.7860107, "longitude": -95.3669968, "state": "TX", "street": "2915 N Main St", "zip": "77009"}, "id": "119943208093381"}, "start_time": "2018-02-07T20:00:00-0600", "id": "1434390886597429"}, {"description": "Sleigh Bells are dropping a new mini-LP in November and coming to play for us in January with Sunflower Bean! \n\nTickets on sale Friday 10/13 @ 10AM: http://bit.ly/2wKiFVO\n$26 adv. / ALL AGES/ Doors: 7PM / Show: 8PM", "end_time": "2018-01-31T23:00:00-0600", "name": "Sleigh Bells with Sunflower Bean 1/31", "place": {"name": "Metro Chicago", "location": {"city": "Chicago", "country": "United States", "latitude": 41.94983509137, "longitude": -87.658790738569, "state": "IL", "street": "3730 N Clark St", "zip": "60613"}, "id": "15599955042"}, "start_time": "2018-01-31T20:00:00-0600", "id": "875028892666872"}, {"description": "20:00 The Beans\n21:00 Rics\u00e1rdg\u00edr\n\n\"A legnehezebb dolog egy ember \u00e9let\u00e9ben az, ha van egy Rics\u00e1rdg\u00edre \u00e9s csak az\u00e9rt nem l\u00e9p fel \u0151sszel, mert elhat\u00e1rozta ezt augusztusban.\" - Bochkor G\u00e1bor.\n\nKib\u00edrtuk, nem l\u00e9pt\u00fcnk fel lassan 3 h\u00f3napja, lemondtunk minden \u0151szi koncertet \u00e9s kedvesen megmondtuk minden szervez\u0151nek aki keresett hogy majd tavasszal.

Das New Yorker Trio h\u00e4tte bekanntlich vor lauter Konzerten \u2013 im Jahre 2014 traten sie rund 50 Mal nur in ihrer Heimatstadt auf, von den weiteren Touren wollen wir gar nicht erst anfangen \u2013 fast vergessen ein Album einzuspielen. Also machten sie eine Pause und nahmen ihre \u00fcberaus gefeierte Deb\u00fctplatte \u201eHuman Ceremony\u201c auf, die Anfang des vergangenen Jahres erschien. Anschlie\u00dfend folgten wieder Shows ohne Ende rund um den halben Globus. Anfang des Monats jedoch der Paukenschlag: \u201eI Was A Fool\u201c, ein neuer Song, rotierte im Netz und schlug einen neuen Weg ein. Eine glasklare akustische Gitarre, ein cooler Basslauf, ein Break, die verhallte Stimme bilden das solide Grundger\u00fcst f\u00fcr einen Track, der leichte musikalische Verschiebungen bei gleichbleibend hoher Qualit\u00e4t verspricht. Schon kurz nach ihrer Gr\u00fcndung 2013 waren S\u00e4ngerin und Bassistin Julia Cumming, Gitarrist Nick Kivlen und Schlagzeuger Jacob Faber eine der meistgehandelten Bands der Ostk\u00fcste und l\u00f6sten ihr Versprechen, eine der aufregendsten Bands zu sein, mit ihren unglaublichen Live-Events ganz locker ein. Mit ihrem DIY-Anspruch und einem w\u00fcsten Haufen von Zitaten waren Sunflower Bean wild, unordentlich, sexy, poliert, nihilistisch, belebend, laut, ernsthaft ins musikalische Leben getreten und hypnotisierten ihre Zuh\u00f6rer mit einem einzigartigen Sound. Daran hat sich nichts ge\u00e4ndert. Neu ist das Label: \u201eI Was A Fool\u201c erscheint bei Mom+Pop, bei dem auch so renommierte und besondere Musiker wie Poli\u00e7a, Cloud Nothings, Jagwar Ma, Courtney Barnett oder Tash Sultana unter Vertrag stehen.
